<b><u>Lowest Common Ancestor</b></u>

<i><b>Explanation of my various commits</b></i>

My commits between 29th September and 1st October were originally called LCA and LCATest.
However, once the next assignment was issued, I found it too awkward to use these in adapting to DAG.
I renamed these two files, OldLCA and OldLCATest. I would have preferred to delete them, but I left them in the same repository so that my progress would be visible.

I decided to start afresh on the 13th October.
I used code from an old assignment (BST), from module CS2010, in combination with some of my original test cases in 'OldLCATest' in writing LCA and LCATest. 

 <i><b>Explanation of the LCA</b></i>

 The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree is the lowest node that has both v and w as descendants.

 Some of the tests I look for include:

 <b>Tests</b>

 1. Check for the lowest common ancestory
 2. Test the constructor
 3. Test a null tree
 4. Test a small tree(at least 2 nodes - including root)
 5. Test same node/elements for LCA
 6. Test for non existing nodes in tree
